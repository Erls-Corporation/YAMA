# note: this never worked properly so routes are currently not translated
#
# needs to be fixed:
# 1) path_for and url_for looks like this:
#      foo?i18n_locale=XX
#    should be:
#      XX/foo
#
# 2) link_to 'foo', :i18n_locale => XX
#    for example when on swedish news page and
#    changing language to english it should go
#    from:
#      sv/nyheter
#    to:
#      en/news
#
# When these two issues are fixed we can start
# using translated URLs.
